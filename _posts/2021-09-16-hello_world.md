也有人直到50岁才当上CEO，

世上每个人都有自己的发展时区。

Absolutely everyone in this world works based on their Time Zone.

身边有些人看似走在你前面，

People around you might seem to go ahead of you,

也有人看似走在你后面。

some might seem to be behind you.

但其实每个人在自己的时区有自己的步程。

But everyone is running their own RACE, in their own TIME.

不用嫉妒或嘲笑他们。

Don't envy them or mock them.

他们都在各自的时区，你在你的！

They are in their TIME ZONE, and you are in yours!

所以，别放弃。

So, Never Give up

你没有落后，

You're not LATE.

你没有领先。

You're not EARLY.

在命运为你安排的属于你自己的时区里，一切都非常准时。

You are very much ON TIME, and in your TIME ZONE Destiny set up for you.

再好，别忘了危机与奋斗，

Keep fighting and stay alert, no matter how good;

再难，别忘了梦想与坚持，

Keep dreaming and carry on, no matter how hard;

再忙，别忘了读书与锻炼，

Keep reading and exercising, no matter how busy;

人生，就是一场长跑。

Life is a long run.
